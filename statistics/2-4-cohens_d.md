[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

First babies mean weight is ~7.201 and other babies mean weight is ~7.326.  
This is a difference of ~ -0.125 less for first babies.  
Cohen's d computed is ~ -0.088673.   
This represents distance between first and other babies means in standard deviations.    
It is negative because the first babies mean weight is less than the other babies mean weight.
